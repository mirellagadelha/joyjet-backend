# Level 1

We are building an e-commerce website. Our customers can:
  - add articles to a virtual cart
  - checkout the cart contents
  - get it delivered the next day

The customer is charged the sum of the prices of each article in their cart.

Write an API that receives a payload like `data.json` and responds as `output.json`.


## Tips:
- Prices are expressed in cents.
- The customer can send one or more `carts`
- The articles is like a MAP for your calculation
- Enjoy while do it :)


## We lovely to see:
- Clean structure
- Clean code
- Unit tests
- Good documentation describing `how the project works and how to run then`.
