# Level 3

Some products are discounted because of a deal we made with the supplier.

### There are two kinds of discounts:
- a direct cut to the article's price, e.g. get 50€ off your 300€ caviar tin and only pay 250€
- a percentage discount, e.g. get 20% off your 5€ creme fraiche and only pay 4€


Write an API that receives a payload like `data.json` and responds as `output.json`.


## Tips:
- Prices are expressed in cents.
- The customer can send one or more `carts`.
- The articles is like a MAP for your calculation.
- Pay attention to discounts.
- Enjoy while do it :)


## We lovely to see:
- Clean structure
- Clean code
- Unit tests
- Good documentation describing `how the project works and how to run then`.
